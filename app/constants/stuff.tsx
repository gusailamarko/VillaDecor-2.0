        title: "EARLY LIFE",
        text: "His passion for art was evident from an early age. At school, he achieved excellent results in numerous art competitions and was soon noticed. He later moved to Budapest with his parents, but his poor school average meant that he was not accepted into Art School. His poor school marks were the scars of his very eventful, expensive party-animal phase during his teens and twenties. He managed to get into a vocational school for car polishing and decorating."

        title: "WORKS BEFORE SUCCESS",
        text: "He worked with his father at the Hungarian State Railways as a sign painter/coat of arms painter. But, even during this time, he never stopped pursuing a career in painting. Eventually, he successfully completed his training as an animator at the Pannonia animation studio with the help of his former mentor Zsolt Richly (The Rabbit with the Plaid Ears, L'éléphanteau à pois bleus), whom he annoyed to death with his outstanding skills and cynicism. Later, he became a scene-painter in foreign productions."

        title: "FIRST SUCCESSES, RISE TOWARDS FAME",
        text: 'His first successes came in the late 1990s in adult comic magazines, where he debuted as "Béla the Animal" (the name "Villa" was taken from the fork cutlery he wore around his neck as a necklace, which has since been transformed into a silver symbol.) He owed a lot to comic books and brought unexpected popularity, but that was just the beginning. The real breakthrough came years later in painting. In a state competition organised by the Hungarian Ministry of Defence, his painting "Kuruc Labanc ütközet (Battle of Kuruc Labanc)" was included in the Stefánia exhibition as the missing piece of Hungarian history, earning the highest possible Hungarian recognition for contemporary painters.'

    {
        title: "HIS HIGH-IN-DEMAND STYLE AND SKILLS",
        text: "His works include realistic, graphic, landscape, animal, portrait, abstract and surrealistic paintings. But because of the large amounts of received orders, he is rarely able to express himself in his own artistic direction, not to mention his works from sculptural decorations to film sets. Realism, Cubism and Surrealism are his favourite trends. He is influenced by his favourites: Salvador Dalí, Hieronymus Bosch, Mihály Munkácsy, Bertalan Székely and his contemporaries. His most recent works are in a consistent style that bears the hallmarks of synthetic cubism, futurism and surrealism."
